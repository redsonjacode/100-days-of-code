Made better progress with FTP today.  All working apart from the last update I made to my HTML file --> the changes are
not showing up when I load the page. 

Also started on another practice web page.  Have the week off from new lessons so really want to take advantage of that by 
repeating all the things I've learned; will be easier to build on new skills if the foundation is solid.  

Press on!
