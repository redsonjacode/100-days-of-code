Still working on FTPing my files.  I had to fix the structure of my folders and in doing so, it ended up being a g
reat learning experience.  Now I'm uploading the files again but I'm finding that the FTP client I have to use (through 
Dreamhost) doesn't accept my folder structure, which means my refs to images, etc. will have to be changed from "img/" to 
nothing in front.  

I'll work on getting in touch with Pydio (the FTP client) to see what can be done.  

I also deleted some files from the FTP folder (that I hadn't uploaded) which must have been important (!!) as now I get a 
404 message on the site when I try to see it online.  oops.  

All good stuff.  Breaking things is a great way to learn!!

Also listened to a great Blockchain Webinar about Hyperledger Fabric project.  Think I need to learn to code smart contracts...
(I said it HERE first.)
