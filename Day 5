Worked on adding images and float experiments (based on what I'm learing in my tutorials this week).  

Also worked 'offline' a bit, doing some planning for layout and content.  

Trying not to overcomplicate what I'm doing at the moment.  I need to get the basics down before I can expect to make 
it beautiful!

(A) Good morning!
