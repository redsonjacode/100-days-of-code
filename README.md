# 100-days-of-code
Taking on the #100daysofcode challenge in 2017 (starting Jan 17)

Rules

I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days
If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
I will update the with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
