Taking on the #100daysofcode challenge in 2017 (starting Jan 17)

<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days</p>
<p>If I code in a paid class/tutorial, that time won't count towards the challenge.</p>
<p>I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.</p>
<p>I will tweet my prgress on Twitter every day.</p>
<p>I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.</p>
