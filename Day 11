Spent a lot of time still working on getting my css file to work on my website.  Fixed that (had to do with how my folders 
were FTP'd (or, in this case, not) so the paths in the html files were technically incorrect. 

Still having trouble with some images so working on de-bugging.  A good exercise. Just feels so so so so slow (for what I 
know - hope? - will be a cakewalk in the hopefully near future.
