Lots of learning today.  Nothing really new to post/upload but I'm spending my time learning intensively and feeling 
good that the hour of code is much looked forward to everyday.  

So much so, I often go over an hour a day!  

Am using the W3 schools website for a lot of guidance.  http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar
